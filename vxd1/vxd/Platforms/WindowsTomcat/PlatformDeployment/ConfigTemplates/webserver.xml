Element
    Attribute(s)
    Element(s)
========================================================

WebServer - A collection of web services managed by a
            single HTTP Web Server instance.

    id - A Unique Web Server id.
    adminPort - The Web Server administration port
                number which is used as an external
                Web Server hook to invoke administrative
                tasks such as gracefully shutting down
                the web server (note: these services
                are presently not specified and as such
                are subject to change).

    Service - A managed web service.

Service - A distinct web resource which is associated
          with a fully qualified URI.

    id - A unique Service id.
    port - The port number with which the Service is
           registered.
    hostName - The system host name in which the Service
               is hosted.
    inet - The system ip address in which the Service is
           hosted.
    docBase - The Service document base.
    workDir - The Service work directory.
    workDirIsPersistent - Indicator as to whether or not
                          the Web Server should return
                          the associated work directory
                          to the host system upon shut
                          down.

    WebApplication - A managed association of web resources.

WebApplication - A collection of associated web resources
                 which correspond to a distinct fully
                 qualified URI.

    id - A unique Web Application id.
    mapping - The URI prefix with which this Web Application
              is associated with relative to the hosted
              Service.
    docBase - The Web Application document base.
    maxInactiveInterval - The maximum session timeout
                          period.

========================================================

command line options:

	-help                     This Message
	-config [file|url]        Read config from URL
	-noconfig                 Do not read config
	-adminport [int]          Administration Port
	-serviceid [str]          Service Id
	-port[:id|:*] [int]       Listen on int [for Service id]
	-inet[:id|:*] [inetaddr]  Bind server to inet [for Service id]
	-hostname[:id|:*] [name]  Use name as hostname [for Service id]
	-docbase[:id|:*] [name]   Use URL as the content base [for Service id]
	-workdir[:id|:*] [name]   Use scratch file [for Service id]

========================================================

configuration attribute details:

    All "id" values must be unique with a collection
    of like elements.

    Most configuration values can be declared in one
    of following three means respectively:

        command line
        xml declaration
        default as specified by the dtd and/or
            application

    Many fields have default falues which are either
    specified in the associated dtd or within JSWDK.
    These default values can be changed by modifying
    the included webserver.xml and fully qualifying
    the appropriate element attributes.

    A JSWDK server can be started on any platform
    with no changes to the provided default
    webserver.xml configuration.

    The JSWDK server will create a default
    configuration file upon initialization if it does
    not find one either by looking in the JSWDK
    install directory for the file "webserver.xml or
    the "-config [file | url]" command line option.

    If an explicit WebServer.adminPort value is not
    specified then a series of 5 attempts will be
    made to bind to an available port number randomly
    chosen between the range of 2048 and 8192. Upon
    success, the chosen administration port is logged
    in the "webserverlog.txt" file. If an administration
    port cannot be determined, the web server will
    not be started.

    The WebServer.id field is likely to be removed
    in a future release.

    The Service.id field is required as the key for
    the command line arguments. Duplicate Server.port
    entries will cause the subsequent duplicate Services
    to be disregarded.

    The Server.hostName is opional and a value of
    "localhost" will be used if it remains
    unspecified.

    A Server.port field must be unique within a
    collection WebServer configuration. Subsequent
    Service instances specified with duplicate port
    numbers will fail initialization.

    The Server.docBase is the file system location
    which is accessed by the Web Server to route
    inbound http requests to a specific Service instance
    and not picked up by an associated Web Application.
    A document base can be specified as relative or
    absolute and need not reside within the JSWDK install
    directory. It should be possible to specify URI
    addresses as well effectively turning this WebServer
    Service instance into a proxy server although this is
    experimental with this release.

    The Server.workDir specfies the local file system
    directory available to the Web Server as needed to
    use as a cache, archive object persistence among
    other tasks. The work directory can be specified
    as relative or absolute and need not reside within
    the JSWDK install directory.

    The Server.workDirIsPersistent is an indicator to
    the WebServer to either save or return to the host
    system the associated work directory. This field is
    likely to be renamed to "isWorkDirPersistent" in a
    future release.

    The WebApplication.id field is likely to be
    removed in a future release.

    The WebApplication.mapping is used to specify the
    URI prefix with which this Web Application
    instance is to be associated with. The specified
    value of this field must be unique amongst a
    collection managed by a single Service instance.
    This field is likely to be renamed to "path" in a
    future release.

    The WebApplication.docBase is the file system
    location which is accessed by the Web Server to
    service inbound http requests routed to this
    specific Web Application instance. This field
    shares many of the attributes specified in the
    Server.docBase description above.

    The WebApplication.maxInactiveInterval is not
    utilized at this time and will likely specify
    the "session time out in minutes" threshold in
    a future release.

========================================================

Miscellany:

    Any number of Service and/or Web Application
    instances can be readily added to an existing Web
    Server configuration by adding the appropriate and
    valid (as specified by the dtd and associated rules)
    xml details.
