Visual XML Designer Overview for Executives

Executive Summary

Visual XML Designer allows a user to easily develop products with
 a mouse oriented drag and drop interface that is intuitive.  The
idea is to draw a program with icons and connections to generate an XML document
that represents the diagram. That document can then be instructions to the engine
for that type of document.  Alternatively, the document can be converted to the
destination language.

What Visual XML Designer Provides

Many sets of toolboxes will be provided for different types of development.  Thes toolboxes
are simply different sets of pictures and connectors.  Second, several engines and converters
will be provided.  The engines read the documents created and the converters convert the
documents.

Use Case for Web Development

First the user draws the pictures and connects the concepts. An XML
Document is generated from this drawing.  Now the document can be
fed into the Web Engine for running.  Alternatively you can use the
Java Servlet Program Generator on the same document to
generate java code for more customization.

In Conclusion

This Product defines several visual languages which are simply sets of pictures and connectors.
This visual language is ultimately saved as xml.  Engines can run that xml language directly
or Converters can change that language to another.
